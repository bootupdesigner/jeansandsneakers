                story: "Self-worth is seeing yourself as having value. Self-esteem is how you are feeling about yourself. Before self-esteem comes self-worth. If you don’t see yourself as valuable, you will never feel great about who you are."

                story: "Negative messages and thoughts about yourself can make your self-worth fragile. So, instead of kicking yourself for a mistake you’ve made, it is healthier to accept that humans make mistakes. Then, learn what you can from the mistake and decide not to repeat the same mistake again."

                story: "Positude is a very simple concept; it means having a positive attitude. Regardless of your current state in life, you CAN change the way you think and feel. And you do that by visualizing the negative, then turning around and seeing yourself as being happy, content and joyous with the things that are going right in your life and with your family."
