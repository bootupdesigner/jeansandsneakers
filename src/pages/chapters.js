                    `Self-worth is seeing yourself as having value. Self-esteem is how you are feeling about yourself. Before self-esteem comes self-worth. If you don’t see yourself as valuable, you will never feel great about who you are.`,

                    `Your self-worth affects every aspect of your life. It determines whether you will lead or follow. Whether you have sex before you want or wait until it’s your time. Whether you will strike out with your own business or continue to work in a job that you hate. Whether you will be content and happy with four excellent friends or “fake” happy with forty. And whether you will be the girl with the guy who treats you better than the lyrics of a great love song or the girl with the guy who calls you a b##ch and hits you.
                `,
                    `I have been depressed, and it made me forget that I was worthy of everything God had placed on this earth for me. I almost killed myself, but I cried out for God to help me, because I knew that His presence was always there. It was painful. And I hurt. But growth in life comes from pushing through and learning after times of pain and hurt. So don’t give up; don’t give in. Just grit your teeth, hold on and know that you are worthy of life and God’s love.`
